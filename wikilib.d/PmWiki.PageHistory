text=%25audience%25 authors (basic) %0a%0aWhen PmWiki is called with '?action=diff', it displays a summary of past edits on a page. Each past edit is shown in a box which shows lines added, changed or deleted during that edit in a before & after format.%0a%0aBelow each box is a "Restore" link. Clicking the link will open an edit box with the page as it was ''before'' that edit.  You can make changes or simply click Save to restore the text.%0a%0aThere are two additional options specific to Page''''History:%0a* '''Hide minor edits''' - hides any edit that the author marked as 'minor'.%0a* '''Show changes to markup'''- shows changes to the markup (as opposed to the normal display which shows changes to the output).%0a%0aA page's history is kept for the number of days given by the $DiffKeepDays variable (set by the site's [[wiki administrator]]).  When a page is edited, any page history information older than this value is automatically discarded.%0a%0aNote that a specific page revision isn't removed from the page until the first edit ''after'' the time specified by $DiffKeepDays has elapsed. Thus, it's still possible for some pages to have revisions older than $DiffKeepDays -- such revisions will be removed the next time those pages are edited.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%25trail%25 %3c%3c|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>%0a
