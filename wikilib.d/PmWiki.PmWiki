text=PmWiki is a [[wiki(WikiWeb)]]-based system for collaborative creation and maintenance of websites.%0a%0aPmWiki pages look and act like normal web pages, except they have an "[[Main/WikiSandbox?action=edit|Edit]]" link that makes it easy to modify existing pages and add new pages into the website, using [[basic editing]] rules. You do not need to know or use any %25newwin%25[[http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/|HTML]] or %25newwin%25[[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/|CSS]]. Page editing can be left open to the public or restricted to small groups of authors.%0a%0a!!Key PmWiki Features%0a%0a-%3c'''Templates''': PmWiki offers a template scheme ([[skins]]) that makes it possible to change its layout with a high degree of flexibility in both functionality and appearance.%0a%0a-%3c'''Access control''': PmWiki permits users to establish password protection for individual pages or groups of pages, for example to establish defined zones for collaborative work by certain groups, such as in a company intranet.  Password protection can be applied to reading, editing, uploading to and changing passwords for the restricted zone.  PmWiki can also be configured to make use of existing password databases, such as ''.htaccess'', LDAP servers, and MySQL databases.%0a%0a-%3c'''Customization''': PmWiki follows a [[PmWikiPhilosophy | design philosophy]]. Its main objectives are ease of installation, maintainablilty, and keeping non-required features out of the core engine. PmWiki's core engine design seeks to encourage customization with a varied selection of custom extensions, collectively known as the "[[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]]".%0a%0aPmWiki is written in %25newwin%25[[http://php.net/|PHP]] and distributed under the %25newwin%25[[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html|General Public License]].  It is designed to be simple to [[PmWiki/install(ation)]], customize, and maintain for a variety of applications.
